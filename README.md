# CustomGalleryApp

This is a custom Android gallery app that displays images and videos in a single screen as album
views. The app categorizes media into folders, allowing the user to view images and videos based on
their folder structure in the device. The gallery provides a user-friendly interface to view all
images, videos, camera photos, and specific albums.

Features

Album View: The app will show all the media folders present in the device.
For example, if the device contains images in a folder named Screenshots, it will show all those
images under the Screenshots album.

All Images: A folder that displays all the images available in the device, excluding cache,
thumbnails, and no-media files.
All Videos: A folder that displays all the videos available in the device, excluding cache,
thumbnails, and no-media files.
Camera Folder: Displays all the images taken using the camera, grouped under the Camera album.
Detailed View: Clicking on any album will redirect to the detailed view where the media content of
that album (images and videos) is displayed.
UI Design

The appâ€™s UI is designed to be clean and easy to navigate:

Main Screen: Displays a list of all albums with the folder name and the number of media files (
images or videos) in each folder. This is done in a grid or list format for ease of use.
Album Detail Screen: When an album is selected, the detailed view screen is shown, displaying all
media files (images/videos) present in that album, along with options to play
videos.
